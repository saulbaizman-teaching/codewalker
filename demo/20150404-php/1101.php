<?php

print ( 'hello world 1.' ) ;

                     <?php print ( 'hello world 2.' ) ; ?>

<!-- Note: whitespace *between* the closing and opening tags matters,
insofar as it matters in HTML. Meaning, multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space, per usual. -->

<!-- You can embed PHP anywhere in your HTML document. -->

<!-- There are multiple ways to embed PHP in your document, but we'll just look at one today. When we look at WordPress next week, it uses a different method. -->
