+ bookmarks to jump to a particular demo and step (via query string)

+ Add code editability and preview / execution window.

+ Rewrite this application using 100% JavaScript/jQuery.

+ Get rid of explicit function calls in scripts.js; just use jQuery.

There's a flicker issue when this is on a network since it takes a few moments for the steps to load, and the fade ends *before* the new content has loaded.
The flicker issue may actually be due to larger files and the Rainbox() method taking a moment to reformat the code.
"Failed to load resource: Frame load interrupted" - Console error. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12359600/failed-to-load-resource-frame-load-interrupted-agian for possible solutions.

Instructions for embedding languages within other languages:

Match using another language

The following allows php code to be embedded into an HTML block:
Rainbow.extend('html', [
    {
        'name': 'source.php.embedded',
        'matches': {
            2: {
                'language': 'php'
            }
        },
        'pattern': /<\?(php)?([\s\S]*?)(\?>)/gm
    }
], true);
You should be able to nest sub-patterns as many levels deep as you would like.
