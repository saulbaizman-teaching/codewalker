TO DO

+ bookmarks to jump to a particular demo and step (via query string)

+ how to handle demos with multiple files? One (bad) solution: just put everything in a single file. This is bad because there are lots of extraneous bits in the HTML that we don't care about.

+ Add code editability and preview / execution window.

FIXME
--
+ In download.php, prepend in a comment the description from the ini file.

+ For unrecognized languages, don't echo the full rainbox js <pre>...; in other words, disable syntax color highlighting

Instructions for embedding languages within other languages:

Match using another language

The following allows php code to be embedded into an HTML block:
Rainbow.extend('html', [
    {
        'name': 'source.php.embedded',
        'matches': {
            2: {
                'language': 'php'
            }
        },
        'pattern': /<\?(php)?([\s\S]*?)(\?>)/gm
    }
], true);
You should be able to nest sub-patterns as many levels deep as you would like.
