TO DO
--
+ bookmarks to jump to a particular project and step (via query string)
+ how dto handle demos with multiple files? One (bad) solution: just put everything in a single file. This is bad because there are lots of extraneous bits in the HTML that we don't care about.
+ Autodetect syntax highlighting based on filename extension.

+ Add code editability and preview / execution window.

FIXME
--
no parentheses or single quotes in the PROJECT_DESCRIPTION in demo.ini.php
