## about

This is a simple file viewer for viewing the demos used in my classes at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.

The demos are stored in subfolders of the `demo` folder.

To view the demos, open index.html in a web browser.

If you want to use codewalker for your own purposes, customize `config.json`.
