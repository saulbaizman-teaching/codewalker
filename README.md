This is a simple file viewer for viewing the demos used in Intermediate Web Design (CMP 3011) at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Spring 2015.

The demos are stored in subfolders of the `demo` folder.

To view the demos, this entire folder must be placed on a webserver that supports PHP. It should probably be located at the root of the web server, though it may work in subfolders. I recommend creating a fake virtual host like we did in assignment 3 and running this locally.
