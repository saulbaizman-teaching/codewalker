## about

This is a simple file viewer for viewing the demos used in my classes at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.

The demos are stored in subfolders of the `demo` folder.

To view the demos, open Terminal and spin up a web server in the document root directory like so:

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Then point a web browser to this address:

`http://localhost:8000/`
